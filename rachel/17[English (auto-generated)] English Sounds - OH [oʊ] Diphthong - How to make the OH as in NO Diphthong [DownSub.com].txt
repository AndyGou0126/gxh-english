in this American English pronunciation

video we're going to learn how to

pronounce the Oh as in no diphthong

diphthongs are a combination of two

sounds they have a starting position and

an ending position the jaw drops for the

beginning position tongue shifts back a

little bit the lips may start relaxed or

may start rounding right from the

beginning after dropping the jaw

immediately start moving into the ending

position the lips round and the back

part of the tongue stretches up focus on

the movement of the jaw and the lip

rounding let's see this sound up close

and in slow motion jaw drop for the

first position

and rounded lips for the second the word

slow

notice how the lips are not relaxed in

the first position of this diphthong

with the jaw drop their flared which

does not affect the sound as they

prepare to round for the ending position

rounded lips in a stressed syllable the

Oh diphthong curves up then down slow oh

in an unstressed syllable it's lower and

flatter and pitch as well as quieter and

quicker oh the diphthong is unstressed

in the word okay oh let's take a look at

the word okay

the jaw drops but not quite as much as

it did on the stressed syllable of slow

the lips begin to round for the

transition into the ending position the

lips round but not quite as much as for

the stressed Oh in slow

here we compare the first position of

the stressed Oh on top with the

unstressed version on the bottom less

jaw drop for the unstressed version and

here the second position you can see

that for the stressed Oh on top the lips

round more than they do in the

unstressed version generally the

unstressed version of a vowel or

diphthong is more relaxed and often

doesn't take the full mouth position in

this case less jaw drop and less lip

rounding this is because we don't take

as much time for unstressed syllables

they're shorter so we simplify the mouth

movements the Oh diphthong stressed slow

Oh unstressed okay oh oh-oh-oh-oh

example words repeat with me alone

Oh alone tomorrow Oh tomorrow home oh

home window Oh window phone ohh phone

social Oh social
