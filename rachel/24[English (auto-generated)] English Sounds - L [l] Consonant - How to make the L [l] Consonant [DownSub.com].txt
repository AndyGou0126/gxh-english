in this american english pronunciation

video we're going to learn how to

pronounce the l consonant sound

this sound is especially difficult

there are actually two kinds of ls

and they're not made the same way

but if you look up a word in the

dictionary there's only one

international phonetic alphabet symbol

for both kinds of l

in this video you'll learn when to make

which kind of l

first

the light l sound this is what most

people think of when they think of an l

the l is a light l when it comes before

the vowel or diphthong in a syllable

for example let's

flake

release

there are two different ways native

speakers make this sound

one way is to lift the tongue so the tip

is touching the roof of the mouth

just behind the front teeth

this is not the same as the t

d and n tongue positions where the

tongue lifts so the top is touching the

roof of the mouth

this is the tip

another way native speakers make this

sound looks like the th

with the tongue tip touching the bottom

of the top front teeth

the contact with the teeth is more firm

than the th sound pushing up on the top

teeth the tongue is not as loose or

relaxed in the l as it is in the th

let's look at the light l up close and

in slow motion

here's one way to make the l with the

tongue tip coming through the teeth to

press up on the bottom of the top front

teeth here's the second way to make the

light l

the tip at the roof of the mouth just

behind the teeth

here's the word

lack the tongue comes through the teeth

to make the light l

the word slow

the light l is made with the tongue tip

at the roof of the mouth

the second kind of l is the dark l

this is the sound that happens when the

l comes after the vowel or diphthong in

a word or syllable like

real

or

google

this sound has two parts but many

americans leave out the second part in

most cases

you should too it makes it easier to

pronounce

the first and most important part of the

dark l is the dark sound

this defines the dark l

to make this sound you don't lift your

tongue tip

instead it's down touching the back of

the bottom front teeth

the back part of the tongue pulls back

towards the throat

you can see there isn't much jaw drop

and the lips are relaxed

oh

you should feel the vibration in the

throat and not the face

the back part of the tongue presses down

or shifts back

this is an important part of the sound

most americans will stop there when

making the dark l

real

google

thoughtful

unless they're linking into a word that

begins with an l

or a sound with a similar position

like n t or d

in that case go ahead and make the

second part of the dark l

the second part of the dark l is the

light l

bring your tongue tip up to the roof of

the mouth or through the teeth

some native speakers make the full dark

l

both parts

all the time

what's important is the dark sound

make it with the back of the tongue

and make sure you never leave that part

out

again the dark l has two parts

the first and most important part

the tongue pulls back or presses down in

the back

the second part which is often left out

either option for the light l

here the option with the tongue tip at

the roof of the mouth is pictured

let's look at the dark l up close and in

slow motion

the word feel

the tongue tip arches in the front for

the e vowel

watch as the tongue lowers in the back

now the tongue is lowered pulling back a

little bit in the back

it's hard to see because of the lips but

the tip of the tongue is still forward

notice that the lips are relaxed

the word recall the dark part is made

with the back of the tongue as the jaw

closes

this time the dark l does end with the

second part the light l

the tongue tip quickly comes through the

teeth

lips are relaxed

the relaxation of the lips is important

in the dark l

many non-native speakers want to round

or flare the lips which brings the sound

forward and changes it

but the dark sound is made back here

leave the lips relaxed so the sound can

be made in the back of the mouth

when you look at the international

phonetic alphabet transcription for a

word in a dictionary you'll just see one

symbol whether it's a light l or a dark

l

it's up to you to know when to make a

dark l when the l comes at the end of a

syllable

remember we're talking about sounds and

not letters

in the example google

you see the letter e after the l

e is a vowel

but when you look at the phonetic

transcription of the word

the last sound is the l

so the l in google is a dark l

o

google

if you integrate a good dark l into your

speech it will help you sound
