in this American English pronunciation

video we're going to study how to make

the T and D consonant

sounds these two sounds are paired

together because they take the same

mouth

position T is unvoiced meaning only air

passes through the mouth and D is voiced

meaning D you make a sound with the

vocal

cords these consonants are complicated

because the way Americans pronounce them

isn't always what you'll find in a

dictionary first let's talk about the

true

pronunciation these are stop consonants

which means there are two parts first a

stop in the airf flow and second a

release

we stop here by closing the vocal cords

and lift the tongue so the flat top part

is at the roof of the mouth it's far

forward almost touching the back of the

top front teeth the teeth come together

and we release all three parts at once

the tongue comes down from the roof of

the mouth The Teeth

part and we release the air in the

throat

t d

d just like with other stop consonants

we want to release them into the next

sound let's look at the true T and D

consonants up close and in slow motion

the teeth come together and the top

front of the tongue is at the roof of

the mouth the air stops in the throat

then the teeth part and the tongue pulls

down to

release the word desk the teeth close

and the tongue is at the roof of the

mouth then everything releases right

into the e as in bed

vowel the word stick the teeth close and

the tongue is at the roof of the mouth

then everything releases right into the

I as in sit

vowel the word expect the teeth nearly

Clos and the tongue is at the roof of

the mouth then the Teeth release just a

bit there's no next sound to release

into so the movement is minimal for the

release the tongue releases

down it's possible to make the true D

without the teeth coming together

said

d

d because of the voice in this sound we

can still release it

said D but to make the true T the teeth

do have to come together or nearly

together

set that was the true T and true D if

the t or d are at the end of a sentence

or if the next word begins with a

consonant then we make a stop t or stop

D we stop the air

but we don't release it you lift your

tongue into position stop the air and

that's it for example the word

mad

mad notice the last sound

is the beginning of the

D with the vocal cords engaged because

it's a voiced consonant

and that's all I don't release a release

would sound like this

mad D but instead I say

mad leaving my tongue tip up now let's

look at an example with a t followed by

another consonant the phrase not for me

here the t is followed by F I stop the

air

not and then without releasing go into

the F sound not for not for me with stop

consonant we do stop the air in the

throat so I don't have to move my tongue

up into position for the T to stop the

sound in this phrase not for me I

touched the roof of my mouth with a part

of the tongue that's further back not

my tongue tip can stay down this helps

me make the stop even shorter so I can

quickly go into the next sound

notur

notur I'll bring my tongue up for the

stop te if the next sound also requires

the tongue being at the roof of the

mouth when I say not for me instead of

not for me the word words are more

connected and the sentence is

smoother that's what we want in American

English and that's why we use the stop

te instead of the true te in these

cases not for me not for

me not for

me let's look at a stop up close and in

slow

motion here's the word what I don't

release the T at the end the tongue goes

to the roof of the mouth but then I just

stop the air my teeth aren't together

and I don't release the lips simply

close

what here's what it looks like with a

true tea the teeth come together then a

subtle

release compare the ending the top is

what with a stop te and the bottom is

what with a true te for the stop te the

teeth don't come together because they

don't need to release the air simply

stops with the tongue in position for

the true tea we bring the teeth together

so the tongue teeth and air

release the stop T and D relate to the

true T and D we simply skip the

release but when the t or d come between

two vowels or diff thongs or after after

an r and before a vowel or diff thong we

make a different sound one exception if

the t or d starts a stressed syllable

then it's a true t or d but in other

cases when the t or d consonants come

between two vowels or D thongs or after

an r and before a vowel or D thong we

make a flap

sound this is different from the true

and St stop tnd D because we don't stop

the sound we don't hold anything we

simply let the front part of the tongue

bounce against the roof of the mouth

without stopping the flow of air the

flap T and flap D sounds the same the T

in matter is the same as the D in

matter

matter

matter this sounds just just like the r

in many languages but in American

English it's the flap t or flap D in my

videos I use the d symbol for this sound

this sound however isn't a stop

consonant

anymore let's look at some words with a

flap up close and in slow motion the

word City here the t comes between two

vowel sounds so it's a flap the tongue

is in position for the I vowel watch how

it flaps against the roof of the mouth

quickly the air doesn't stop that flap

was fast even in slow motion let's watch

again the whole word one more

time the word party here the t comes

after an r and before a vowel so it's a

flap the tongue is back anded up for the

r

watch it

flap and come down from the flap the air

didn't stop watch the whole word one

more

time the word tidy here the D comes

after a diff thong and before a vowel so

it's a flap D watch the tongue

flap the whole word one more

time to isol the sound try holding out

the sound before and after

part then you can really feel the tongue

flap bouncing against the roof of the

mouth remember this isn't represented in

dictionaries they will show the symbol

for the true T party even though

Americans pronounce it party so remember

the rule when a te t or d comes between

vowels and diff thongs or after an R

before a vowel or diff thong like party

unless it starts a stressed syllable

flap the

tongue sometimes we drop the t or d

completely we leave the sounds out this

is an American habit if you look up the

words in the dictionary the sounds are

there there are two cases when you might

hear an American drop a t or

d first when the t or d comes between

two consonant sounds for example

exactly this word has the k t l

consonant together but most people

pronounce it without the T

exactly full

pronunciation

exactly common

pronunciation exactly

dropping the T between two consonants

simplifies the

pronunciation also we often drop the T

when it comes after an N many Americans

say Center instead of

Center or interview instead of

interview this is a big topic I have a

whole series of videos on the

pronunciation of T and D which you can

find on my

website the true T and D

sounds

desk

stick

expect stop T and

d

mad

not

what the flap T and

D City

party

tidy example words repeat with me

best

T

best

time

T

time

do d

do

OD

odd there's no way to make a stop T

sound on its own because it isn't a

sound it's a lack of sound

cut

cut

better

better
