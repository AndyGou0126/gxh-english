in this american english pronunciation

video we're going to learn how to

pronounce the a as in say diphthong

diphthongs are a combination of two

sounds so they have a starting position

and an ending position

in the first position the jaw drops and

the tongue tip touches the back of the

bottom front teeth

the top of the tongue pushes forward and

lifts a bit

the second sound is the i as in sit

vowel

to transition into this position your

jaw will lift as the top front part of

the tongue arches towards the roof of

the mouth

let's look at a word with this sound

pay

the jaw drops and you can see a lot of

tongue as the front and middle push up

and forward

as the top front part of the tongue

arches up towards the roof of the mouth

the jaw comes up lips are relaxed for

this diphthong

pay

in a stressed syllable like pay

in an unstressed syllable it's lower and

flatter in pitch

as well as quicker and quieter

let's take a look at this word

see a lot of tongue as the front and

middle push up and forward

jaw drop may be a little less when this

diphthong is in an unstressed syllable

as we tend to simplify mouth movements

shorter
