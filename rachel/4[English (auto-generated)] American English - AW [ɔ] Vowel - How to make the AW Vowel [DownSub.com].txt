in this American English pronunciation

video we're going to learn how to

pronounce the aw as in law vowel

this vowel sound when pure is quite

similar to the AH as in father vowel in

some areas of the United States we don't

even make this sound we always use the

OO as in father sound instead also when

this vowel is followed by the our

continent

it changes we'll go over that first

let's study the mouth position to make

this vowel the jaw drops and the tongue

shifts back the tip of the tongue

doesn't touch anything the lips flare a

bit ah one technique that might help you

make this sound is to think of the

cheeks coming in and shifting forward

just a little bit oh this is a way to

make it different from the AH as in

father vowel where the lips and cheeks

are totally relaxed ah ah let's watch up

close and in slow motion the jaw drops

the lips flare out a little bit and the

tongue pulls back let's compare with the

aw as in father vowel on top in AH the

lips are relaxed in all the lips flare

also notice how the tongue pulls back in

the all vowel

in a stressed syllable this vowel has

the up-down shape of stress ah ah for

example in the word saw

jaw drops lips flare tongue shifts back

in an unstressed syllable the voice will

be lower in pitch quieter and flatter

unstressed syllables won't be as long ah

ah ah

the voice is unstressed in the word on a

function word on function words are

unstressed Oh note this word can also be

pronounced with the aw as in father

vowel the vowel here is extremely quick

since it's in an unstressed syllable the

tongue tip isn't quite forward the

tongue is in position just an instant

before the tongue flips up to make the N

let's compare the stressed aw in saw on

top with the unstressed o in on the

bottom you can see the jaw drops less

the lips are more relaxed and the tongue

doesn't shift back as much unstressed

syllables are shorter than stressed

syllables so often the unstressed

version of a vowel or diphthong doesn't

take the full mouth position of the

stressed version this vowel can be

effected by following consonants when

the all vowel is followed by the R

consonant the sound does change the lips

flare more and the tongue pulls back

more and up a little bit this is because

we blend the position for the R with the

position for the all when the r follows

the all instead of O the sound is all

core oh oh ah let's look at another word

sore all all sore

oh ah let's compare the pure ah with the

all followed by our in the word quarter

on the bottom you can see for the all

followed by our the lips round more and

the jaw drops less because of the lips

it's hard to see the tongue but it pulls

back and up more than in a pure aa vowel

above pure stressed aw saw aa pure

unstressed ah ah ah ah ah all modified

by our core all all example words repeat

with me boss Oh boss long ah long run

off ah

run off lifelong Oh lifelong login ah

log in wrong

ah wrong daughter

ah daughter
