in this American English pronunciation

video we're going to learn how to

pronounce the ooh as in boo vowel

this sound is a little different from

all of the other vowel sounds other

vowel sounds have one mouth position II

for example and it's the position of the

tongue lips and jaw that make the sound

for this vowel the movement into and out

of the position is just as important as

the position itself ooh we'll talk about

that in a second first let's take a look

at the mouth position to make this sound

the back part of the tongue stretches up

towards the soft palate the front part

of the tongue remains down lightly

touching or just behind the bottom front

teeth I'm sure you can see the lips

around a lot we want to begin this sound

with lips that are more relaxed to move

into this tighter lip position let's

take the word do as an example the lip

position doesn't matter for the D sound

the lips can start moving into the

position for the next sound when making

the D like in the consonant cluster drop

did you see how my lips were already

forming the R when I made the D drop so

what happens when we make the lip

position for ooh as we make the D sound

to do that's not the right sound do do

to make the right American sound the

lips have to start out more relaxed and

then come into this tight circle this

transition into position for the sound

is just as important as the position

itself

let's see up close and in slow motion

lips start in a bigger flare more

relaxed before moving into the tighter

circle look at how much the corners of

the lips come in for this sound now

let's take a look at the word do

remember we don't want to start with the

lips in a tight circle but in a more

relaxed position so they can move into

the tight circle then lips move from the

flare into the tighter circle it might

help to think of this sound as ooh

starting with a more relaxed lip

position ooh in a stressed syllable

you have an up-down shape in the voice

ooh ooh in an unstressed syllable the

pitch will be flatter and lower and it

will be quieter and quicker ooh ooh the

vowel is unstressed in the word visual

let's take a look up close and in slow

motion often unstressed vowels have a

more relaxed lip position notice that

for the vowel the lips do still come

into a tight circle the vowel stressed

do ooh the vowel unstressed visual boo

boo boo boo boo example words repeat

with me blue ooh blue issue boo issue

suit ooh

suit move boo move influence boo
