in this American English pronunciation

video we're going to learn how to

pronounce the UH as in push vowel

to make this sound the corners of the

lips come in a little so the lips flare

away from the face the back of the

tongue lifts towards the back of the

roof of the mouth the front of the

tongue remains down but it might be

pulled slightly back so it's not quite

touching the back of the bottom front

teeth let's look at this sound up close

and in slow motion the lips flare and

the tongue inside the mouth is a little

darker than on other vowels because the

tongue is pulled back here's the word

took the corners of the mouth come in to

flare the lips the back of the tongue

lifts and the front pulls back a little

in a stressed syllable the vowel curves

up then down took ah in an unstressed

syllable its lower and flatter in pitch

as well as quieter and quicker the vowel

is unstressed in the word goodbye let's

look at this word up close and in slow

motion again the lips flare and the

tongue lifts in the back pulling back

the front of the tongue

let's compare the stress version on top

with the unstressed version on the

bottom notice the lips flare a little

less for the unstressed vowel hiding the

bottom teeth generally the unstressed

version of a vowel or diphthong is more

relaxed and doesn't take the full mouth

position in this case a little less lip

flare and possibly less jaw drop this is

because unstressed syllables are shorter

so we don't take the time to make the

full mouth position the stressed aa took

aa unstressed goodbyes example words

repeat with me could uh could book a

book firewood uh firewood sugar Oh sugar

childhood a childhood woman a woman
