in this American English pronunciation

video we're going to learn how to

pronounce the ass as in bat vowel

this is a sounds that changes depending

on the following sound so it can either

be a pure vowel or a modified vowel

we'll go over both in this video to make

the pure a vowel the jaw drops quite a

bit ah the tip of the tongue stays

forward it's touching the back of the

bottom front teeth ah the back part of

the tongue stretches up the tongue is

wide ah because the tongue is high in

the back and low in the front you can

see a lot of it this is different from

the AH as in father vowel for example

where the tongue presses down in the

back and you see more dark space in the

mouth ah ah you can also see the corners

of the mouth pull back and up a little

bit ah let's take a look at the pure a

vowel up close and in slow motion the

tongue tip is down and the back of the

tongue lifts

here's the word sacked the tongue

position is easy to see because of the

jaw drop needed for this vowel

when is in a stressed syllable the vowel

will go up and come down in pitch ah Sat

ah in an unstressed syllable the vowel

is flatter and lower in pitch quieter ah

this vowel is unstressed in the second

syllable of backtrack

let's look up close and in slow motion

in the first stressed syllable the jaw

drops and we see the corners of the lips

pull back and up for the stressed ah in

the unstressed syllable the jaw drops

less let's compare them on top is the

stressed ah you can see the jaw drops

more for the unstressed ah the corners

of the lips are a little more relaxed

than in the stressed version where they

pull slightly back and up

generally the unstressed version of a

vowel or diphthong is more relaxed and

doesn't take the full mouth position in

this case a little less jaw drop and

relaxed lips this is because unstressed

syllables are shorter so we don't take

the time to make the full position at

the beginning of this video I said the

AA vowel is not always a pure aa this

vowel changes when it's followed by a

nasal consonant when it's followed by

the M or n sounds the tongue relaxes in

the back making an a sound after ah ah

it's not a pure ah sound

unfortunately this change is not

represented in the international

phonetic alphabet it's still written

with the same ah symbol so you just have

to know when it's followed by M or n

it's different

we don't say man ah man with a pure ah

we say man

ah ah relaxing the tongue and corners of

the lips before the consonant you can

think of this a relaxation as the UH as

in butter sound or schwa sound let's

look up close and in slow motion at the

word exam first we see the familiar

shape of the mouth when the ad is in a

stressed syllable watch how the

relaxation happens the corners of the

lips relaxed in the tongue will relax

down in the back and the lips closed for

the M consonant

this relaxation of the corner of the

lips and back of the tongue happens when

the a vowel is followed by the N

consonant as well for example the word

hand hand hand so when you see this

symbol followed by this symbol or this

symbol it's no longer a pure aa think of

relaxing out of the vowel ah if the next

sound is the ng consonant it's a little

different rather than aa the vowel

changes into a it's really like the ay

as in say diphthong first the middle

part of the tongue lifts towards the

roof of the mouth then the front part of

the tongue let's watch gang up close and

in slow motion the position for the

first sound looks a lot like aa but the

part of the tongue lifting up is more

forward gang then the front part of the

tongue arches up towards the roof of the

mouth while the tongue tip remains down

[Music]

when you see this symbol followed by

this symbol it's no longer a pure ah

it's more like a gang thanks

pure stressed ah Sat ah pure unstressed

ah back track ah ah ah ah ah a vowel

modified by M exam ah a vowel modified

by n man ah a vowel modified by ng

gang a example words repeat with me

chapter ah chapter can and can act ah

act last ah last Bank a bank bypass
