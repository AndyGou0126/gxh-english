we're going to learn how to make the h

consonant sound

this sound is simply made

by passing air through a very slightly

constricted passage

either between the tongue and the roof

of the mouth

or in the throat

this is an unvoiced consonant

part the lips and press the tongue down

in the back just a little

if you don't constrict the air passage

at all

there's no sound

if you lift the back of your tongue and

constrict too much

you'll feel the vibration of the soft

palate bouncing on the tongue

this is too heavy

the lips and jaw don't affect this sound

so your mouth can be in position for the

next sound when you're making the h

for example the word

how

how

the lips jaw and tongue take the

beginning position of the ow as in now

diphthong

how

let's look up close and in slow motion

the sound by itself the jaw is relaxed

and the lips part

the word hi

there's nothing to see at the beginning

of this word

the h sound happens without changing

what the lips do for the i as in by

diphthong

the word who

again there's nothing to see at the

beginning of this word the h sound

happens without changing what the lips

do for the next sound the u as in boo

vowel

this sound is a most common at the

beginning of a word

and never occurs at the end of a word in

american english

but the letter h does

the h sound

hi

who

example words

repeat with me

hope

hope

history

ahead

ahead

behind

here

somehow
