in this American English pronunciation

video we're going to learn how to make

the ng consonant sound

to make this sound the jaw drops a

little bit hmm the lips part and the

back part of the tongue stretches all

the way up to the soft palate the tongue

tip is forward because the soft palate

is lowered air comes up through the

nasal passages

this makes it a nasal consonant you can

feel the vibration in your nose oh there

are only three nasal sounds in American

English mm-hmm

let's study it up close and in slow

motion a relaxed lowered jaw since this

sound is made at the back of the mouth

it's hard to get a clear picture of it

the tongue lifts in the back while the

tip stays down and forward the word ring

the tongue lifts in the back while the

tip stays down and forward lips are

relaxed the word along since the tongue

is low for the vowel before it's easier

to see the tongue lift in the back and

now it's lifted in the back with relaxed

lips the word finger again the tongue

lifts in the back while the tip stays

down and forward

this sound can occur in the middle or at

the end of a word in American English

but not at the beginning the ng

consonant ring a long finger example

words repeat with me anger anger song mm

song wing mm wing
