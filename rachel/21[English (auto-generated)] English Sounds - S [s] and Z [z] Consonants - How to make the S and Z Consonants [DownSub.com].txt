in this american english pronunciation

video we're going to learn how to make

the s and z

consonant sounds

these two sounds are paired together

because they take the same mouth

position

is unvoiced

meaning only air passes through the

mouth

and z

is voiced

meaning you make a sound with the vocal

cords

to make the sounds the lips part and the

corners pull back a little while the

teeth themselves

lightly touch

there are two ways to make these sounds

one with the tip of the tongue down

lightly touching the back of the bottom

front teeth

or by pointing the tip of the tongue up

you may find that the position of the

tongue tip depends on the sounds around

the s and z

let's look at these sounds up close and

in slow motion

the teeth lightly touch

tongue tip is down

and you can see a lot of the tongue

through the teeth

point up before the teeth close
