video we're going to learn how to make

the w sound

to make this sound

the lips form a tight circle

the back part of the tongue stretches up

towards the soft palate while the front

part of the tongue lightly touches the

back of the bottom front teeth

to give this sound the right quality you

have to close the vocal cords to get

this sound

which we add to the sound

you release the vocal cords as you

release the lips coming out of the w

sound
