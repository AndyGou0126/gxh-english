in this American English pronunciation

video we're going to learn how to make

the r consonant sound

this is truly one of the hardest sounds

in American English

before I go into how to make it I want

to talk about how not to make it

in many languages the r is made by

bouncing the front part of the tongue

against the roof of the mouth

ra

in American English this sound is the t

or d between vowels but it's quite

different from the American r

ER

you can't hold out

but you should be able to hold out the

American r

ER

this consonant is voiced

there are two ways to make this sound

in the first way the front part of the

tongue pulls back and up like this

the tongue can be stretched so it's long

and skinny or it can be pulled into

itself so it's fatter and thicker and

that's what we want here

we're making the tongue fatter and

thicker so it's not as long

the back doesn't move this is happening

with the front and middle of the tongue

the middle part of the tongue lifts up

towards the roof of the mouth you can

touch the sides of the tongue to the

sides of the roof of the mouth here

or to the inside or bottom of the side

teeth here

the front part of the tongue is hanging

in the middle of the mouth

not touching anything

this sound is forward and focused

because of the position of the lips

the corners come in pushing the lips

away from the face this lip Position

will be a little more relaxed when the r

comes at the end of a syllable

we'll compare this way on the left with

the other way to make an r on the right

the r can also be made by flipping the

tongue tip up

the lips flare the same way some native

speakers make the r one way and some the

other

native speakers get the correct sound no

matter the mouth position

but I found that non-native speakers

often drop the jaw too much in this

second method and it makes the sound

hollow

ER

the jaw doesn't need to drop very much

for this sound

ER

so keep this in mind as you work on one

of these two methods

here's the r sound on its own not part

of a word

you can see the lips flare

think of creating a little space between

the inside of your lips and your teeth

notice how little jaw drop there is

we don't need to drop the jaw to pull

the tongue back and up

the word rest when the r is at the

beginning of a word we tend to make the

lips a tight Circle

again little jaw drop as the middle of

the tongue lifts to the roof of the

mouth

the word proud

when R is in a beginning consonant

cluster the lips may not be as tight as

in a beginning r

the word mother

at the end of a syllable the lip

position for the r is definitely more

relaxed than a beginning r but the lips

still flare

here we compare the lip position of the

beginning R in rest above to the ending

are in mother below

the ending are lip position is much more

relaxed

thinking about the lip Position will

help you make a better R sound

as you work on this consonant practice

very slowly thinking about all three

things at once

very little jaw drop the tongue position

and the lip position

remember you can hold out this sound so

that's how you want to practice it

ER

hold it out for five or ten seconds hold

it out as long as you can

when you practice it in a word do the

same

rest

per
