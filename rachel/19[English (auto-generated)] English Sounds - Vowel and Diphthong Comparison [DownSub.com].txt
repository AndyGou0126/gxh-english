video we're going to compare the vowel

and diphthong sounds of American English

the sounds of American English

in these videos we went over the

specifics of the mouth position for each

sound including all of the vowel and

diphthong sounds in American English

in this video we're going to do side by

side comparisons of vowel and diphthong

sounds that are similar

seeing how similar sounds are different

should help you solidify the individual

sounds

relaxed for ah but the corners pull back

and up for ah

oh ah

press your tongue down in the back for

this vowel

the jaw drops more for the first sound

of the diphthong in the word pay but the

here the E vowel is in the word fix

the second half of the diphthong is the

same sound as the E vowel but here the

jaw drops a little less

position for ooh

for the O diphthong the jaw drops a lot

for the beginning sound

then the lips make a tight Circle for

ooh and round but not as much for the

second sound of o

ooh

the beginning position of O looks a lot

like the ah vowel

the sounds of American English

videos in this set will be released here

on YouTube twice a month first and third

Thursdays in 2016 and 2017. but the

whole set can be all yours right now

the real value of these videos is

watching them as a set as a whole to

give your mind the time to take it all

in and get the bigger picture

most of the materials you'll find

elsewhere just teach the sounds on their

own in isolation

it's a mistake to learn them this way we

learn the sounds to speak words and

sentences not just sounds

move closer to fluency in spoken English
