in this American English pronunciation

video we're going to learn how to

pronounce the schwa vowel sound

this vowel is always unstressed the

mouth position is a lot like the UH as

in butter vowel but that vowel can be

and usually is stressed but just like

that vowel everything in your lips jaw

and neck should be relaxed for this

sound just slightly drop your jaw to

make this sound the trick is to keep

everything else relaxed let's look at

the vowel up close and in slow motion

it's possible to make this sound on its

own with just the slightest jaw drop but

in actual words you will likely see a

bit more jaw drop like here on the word

sofa lips relaxed cheeks relaxed tongue

forward and relaxed as I said this vowel

can only be in an unstressed syllable

all other vowel and diphthong sounds can

either be stressed or unstressed so the

schwa will always be really fast and low

in pitch a sofa uh ability uh the schwa

goes with the syllabic consonants l m n

and r that means when you have a

syllable with a schwa followed by one of

these consonants you don't need to make

the schwa it gets absorbed by the next

sound for example the word father there

there just go from the th sound right

into the R sound without trying to make

a separate schwa father there the schwa

always unstressed the sofa ability

uh example words repeat with me allow

allow extra extra data data again again
