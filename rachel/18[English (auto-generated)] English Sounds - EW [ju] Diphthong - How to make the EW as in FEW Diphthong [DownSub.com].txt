we're going to learn how to pronounce

the u as in few diphthong

diphthongs are a combination of two

sounds

they have a starting position

and an ending position

the first sound is the y consonant

diphthongs are normally made up of two

vowel sounds

but in this case the y consonant is

acting as a vowel

for example in the word

music

the y sound goes with the oo vowel to

make a diphthong

rather than with the m consonant to make

a consonant cluster

music

to make the y sound the jaw drops a

little bit

the lips may be relaxed or they may

begin rounding for the ending position

the tongue tip is down lightly touching

the back of the bottom front teeth

the mid front part of the tongue lifts

and touches the roof of the mouth about

here it pushes forward against the roof

of the mouth before pulling away

as we move the tongue on the roof of the

mouth we close the vocal cords to get

this sound

which we add to the sound

we release it the same time we release

the tongue

to transition into the next sound we

release right into the position of the

oo as in boo vowel the tongue tip

doesn't need to move

it remains touching the back of the

bottom front teeth the back part of the

tongue lifts towards the soft palate

the lips round

let's study a word with this sound

use

jaw drops just a little bit as the

tongue lifts and presses forward against

the roof of the mouth the lips flare in

preparation for the rounding at the end

of the diphthong

tongue releases

lifts in the back

and the lips round

in a stressed syllable the u diphthong

curves up then down

use

u

in an unstressed syllable its lower and

flatter in pitch

as well as quieter and quicker

you

you

the diphthong is unstressed in the word

interview

you

let's take a look at the word interview

a little bit of lip rounding in the

first position of the diff long

but in the ending position the lip

rounding is subtle

not like in a stressed you diphthong

let's compare the ending position of the

stressed you diphthong above with the

unstressed diphthong below

in the stressed version the lips round

much more

generally the unstressed version of a

vowel or diphthong

is more relaxed and doesn't take the

full mouth position

in this case

less lip rounding

this is because we don't take as much

time for unstressed syllables

they're shorter

so we simplify the mouth movements
