in this American English pronunciation

video we're going to learn how to make

the a as in bird sound

I sometimes say this is the vowel

version of the R consonant it's always

followed by R and there's no distinction

between the sounds in American English

this sound will always be written with

two different international phonetic

alphabet or IPA symbols but will be

pronounced a just one sound bird to make

this sound the corners of the lips come

in pushing the lips away from the face

the middle part of the tongue lifts

towards the roof of the mouth in the

middle the front of the tongue hangs

down but it's drawn back a bit so it's

not touching anything as the tongue

lifts in the middle it may be close to

the roof of the mouth without touching

it or it may touch the sides of the roof

of the mouth or the insides or bottom of

the top teeth here ah ah this along with

the R consonant is one of the hardest

sounds to make in American English it's

especially hard because the lip position

hides the tongue position let's take a

look from the side we can't even see the

tongue the front view doesn't help much

either this is because the tongue goes

back but the lips flare forward here's

the word

hurt watch the tongue pull back and up

before coming forward for the tea

in a stressed syllable the ERV owl

curves up then down hurt her in an

unstressed syllable it's lower in pitch

as well as quieter and quicker

the vowel is unstressed in the word

research ah let's look at this word up

close and in slow motion the lips flare

but the jaw doesn't drop as much let's

compare the stressed

in hurt on the top with the unstressed

vowel in research on the bottom the lips

flare for both but in this case there

was much more jaw drop for the stressed

version of this vowel this is typical

unstressed vowels are shorter so there

isn't as much time to make the full

mouth position

the Irv vowel stressed hurt her

unstressed research ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

example words repeat with me earth earth

earth search a search circle a circle 13

or 13 return a return outburst or

outburst
