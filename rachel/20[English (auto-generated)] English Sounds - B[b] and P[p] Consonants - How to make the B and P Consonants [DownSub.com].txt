in this American English pronunciation

video we're going to learn how to

pronounce the p and B consonants

these two sounds are paired together

because they take the same mouth

position

p is unvoiced

meaning only air passes through the

mouth

and B is voiced

meaning you make a sound with the vocal

cords

the lips stay together while the teeth

part a little the tongue position

doesn't matter for these consonants so

the tongue can start to get into

position for the next sound

for example if the next sound is the r

consonant the tongue can move back and

up for the r while the lips close for

the B

bring

let's see the sounds up close and in

slow motion the lips press together

and then release

these are stop consonants

in stop consonants there are two parts

there's a stop of the airflow and a

release

the stop of the airflow happens as the

lips close

hat

pin

the release is when the lips part and

the air comes through

pin

happen

[Music]

sometimes native speakers don't release

stop consonants when they come at the

end of a sentence or when the next word

begins with a consonant

for example the common phrase what's up

my lips closed in the p position but I

didn't release the air

what's up

another example

nap time

nap

time

my lips came together for the pee but

they didn't release the air

I stopped the air with my lips then

released it with the next sound the t

consonant

nap time

let's look at some words up close and in

slow motion

the word best the lips pressed together

and then release into the e as in bed

vowel

the word spot

the lips pressed together and then

release into the ah as in Father vowel
