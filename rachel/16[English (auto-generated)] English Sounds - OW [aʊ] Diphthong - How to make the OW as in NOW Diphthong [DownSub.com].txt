in this American English pronunciation

video we're going to learn how to

pronounce the ow as in now diphthong

diphthongs are a combination of two

sounds so they have a starting position

and an ending position to start this

sound drop the jaw the first sound is

similar to the aa as in bat vowel the

tongue is wide and flat the back

stretches up a little bit the tongue tip

touches the back of the bottom front

teeth the upper lip might lift a little

or it will be relaxed to transition into

the second position the lips round and

the jaw drops less the back of the

tongue stretches up more this second

position is considered to the same as

the UH as in push vowel but when it's a

part of a diphthong the lips round more

then when it occurs as a pure vowel

let's see this sound up close and in

slow motion

jaw drops here the upper lip pulls a

little bit the tongue lifts in the back

now the lips come in and round as the

jaw comes up the word wound the lips

start in a tight circle for the W but

then open out for the first position of

the diphthong before rounding again for

the second position of the diphthong

in a stressed syllable the out diphthong

curves up then down wound ow in an

unstressed syllable its lower and

flatter and pitch as well as quieter and

quicker ow ow the diphthong is

unstressed in the word shutdown ow let's

take a look at this word

jaw drops but notice the top lip is

relaxed it doesn't pull up tongue is

lifted in the back in the ending

position the lips aren't quite as

rounded as they were in the stressed

version of this diphthong here you see

the jaw drop in the first position of

the diphthong stressed version on top

notice that the jaw doesn't drop as much

for the unstressed diphthong here's the

second position the lips don't round as

much for the unstressed diphthong

they're more relaxed generally the

unstressed version of a vowel or

diphthong is more relaxed and often

doesn't take the full mouth position in

this case less jaw drop and less lip

rounding this is because we don't take

as much time with unstressed syllables

they're shorter so we simplify the mouth

movements the alwah diphthong stressed

wound ow unstressed shut down ow ow
