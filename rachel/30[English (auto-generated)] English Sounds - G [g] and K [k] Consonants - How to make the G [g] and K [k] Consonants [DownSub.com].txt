we're going to learn how to pronounce

the g and k

consonant sounds

these two sounds are paired together

because they take the same mouth

position

is unvoiced meaning only air passes

through the mouth

and

is voiced

meaning you make a sound with the vocal

cords

these consonants are stop consonants

which means there are two parts to each

sound first a stop in the airflow

and second a release

we stop the flow of air here

closing our vocal cords

while the back part of the tongue

reaches up to touch the soft palate

i'm going to slow down the k sound in

the word back

see if you can hear the stop of air

before the release

back

back

here you can see the tongue position the

back of the tongue reaches up to touch

the soft palate which is closed

the tip of the tongue can remain forward

lightly touching the back of the bottom

front teeth

the jaw drops a little bit and the lips

are open

the lip position doesn't matter for

these sounds

so the lips might start forming the next

sound like in the word

great

here the lips can start taking the

position for the r as we make the g

great

let's look at these sounds up close and

in slow motion

the jaw drops and the back of the tongue

lifts to touch the soft palate

then the tongue releases

sometimes to make a sentence smoother

the words more linked together

native speakers will skip the release of

a stop consonant when the next word

begins with a consonant

for example the phrase back to work

back to

back to

i'm not saying back to

with the full release of the k

i'm holding the air for a fraction of a

second with my throat

making that stop

then i go right into the release of the

t consonant

back to

back to

back to work

without the release of the k in back

the two words flow together more easily

making it smoother

notice i do make a light release of the

k in the word work

can you hear it

back to

work let's look at some words up close

and in slow motion

the word keep

because the tongue lifts at the back and

does not require much jaw drop it's hard

to see this sound in this word

the word green the lips round for the g

because they need to round for the next

sound r

the lip position doesn't change the g

sound

it's a little easier to see the back of

the tongue move when it's at the end of

a word like this word egg the tongue

lifts in the back then releases

the g and k consonants

keep

green

egg

example words repeat with me

go
